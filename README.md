# Impact of RN attrition in the United States:
Our group will be analyzing -What, Where and Why- is causing the attrition in the United States by using the following data sets and overarching questions. We'll be demonstrating our learnings from Modules 1-5 using Pythons, Pandas, and Matplotlib and display our findings using a variety of visualization tools.
